//proposed sketch of reading midi, assuming 2nd version
// we're assuming that the UART module sends MIDI bytes to the processor core, 
// so everything related to timing is shortened to a "see if input has changed" program
//1: see if input in x2 has changed 
//2: assuming yes, go to 3
//3: 
//4:
//5:

.main:

//something something "if the previous input value is NOT the same as the current input value, go to decode. otherwise, do some DSP


.decode:
//checks if data or status
li x15 0x80
and x5 x4 x15
beq x5 x0 .status

.data

//store channel data in memory
//7statuses X 16channels, 12 bytes of data per channel 
//totalling 84 bytes

.status
