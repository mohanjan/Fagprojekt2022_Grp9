CAPNA
=======================

## What is CAPNA?
CAPNA (Complementary Audio Processor Network Ar- chitecture), is a network configuration of individual CAPs (Complementary Audio Processor), each running different DSP applications. This network is synthesized from a con- figuration XML file, which allows the user to specify the interconnections between multible CAPs and the program each CAP runs. The intention with this architecture is to be an uncomplicated, scalable and application tailored digital signal processing.
CAPNA enables the user to accelerate algorithms within digital signal processing (DSP) such as FIR-filtering, machine learning (ML) such as Wavenet and arithmetic calculations such as summation or multiplication.

## Usage
CAPNA is setup using an [XML configuration file](Config) and programmed using [assembly files](Programs).
